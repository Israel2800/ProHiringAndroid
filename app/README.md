The ProHiring logo features three primary tools commonly used for tasks inside and outside the home: a shovel, a hammer, and a wrench. These tools are unified by a semicircular shape in a light aqua-green color. The tools are placed beneath a triangle symbolizing the roof of a house or property.

The logo represents the tools used by professionals registered on ProHiring to perform their services, emphasizing order and structure under the roof of a home. This highlights the commitment of professionals to deliver high-quality services for the properties they serve.

## Justification for Device, Operating System Version, and Supported Orientations
The Android operating system was chosen due to the large number of users currently using devices with this operating system. This project targets android version with a minSdk = 24, which offers enhanced and updated functionalities, ensuring a better user experience.

The app supports vertical orientation only, as this provides a more comfortable and visually appealing graphical representation for users. This choice enhances navigation and usability within the app.
